The hello-world output gave us an ambitious task to do. Do the following

Step 1. Run an Ubuntu container with the command given by hello-world



The step 1 will connect you straight into the container with bash. You will have access to all of the files and tools inside of the container. The following steps are run within the container:

Step 2. Create directory /usr/src/app

Step 3. Create a file /usr/src/app/index.js

Step 4. Run exit to quit from the container
